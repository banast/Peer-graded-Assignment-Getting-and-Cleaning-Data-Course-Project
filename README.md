# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

By the end of the course Getting and Cleaning Data a programming assignment was accomplished. The R code run_analysis.R does the following:
1. Downloads the dataset to the working directory
2. Reads the datasets 
3. Creates new datasets for x, y and subject that combine train and test observations.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Establishes descriptive activity names.
6. Merges observed datasets in one dataset.
7. From this merged dataset creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average
of each variable for each activity and each subject.
